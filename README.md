# Crescendo---R-Task
R Task
For this task we will use the pinnacle.data package from CRAN. pinnacle.data contains a snapshot of odds over time in a subset of Pinnacle's sports betting markets. We will be using the MLB2016 dataset, which is part of this package. You might also like to make use of odds.converter, another Pinnacle package on CRAN, which allows us to easily convert between different odds types and probabilities.


Put all the files in a folder and run App.R to deploy the R-shiny dashboard.
